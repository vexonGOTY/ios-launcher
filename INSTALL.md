# Getting Started on Installing Geode
This page **will help you install Geode on your iDevice**. Unlike other platforms, installing Geode on iOS is not straightforward because of Apple's strict policy of not directly allowing apps outside of the App Store.

> [!WARNING]
> Geode **only works from iOS 14 to the latest iOS version**. Geode will not work on iOS versions below iOS 14.

> [!TIP]
> If you **don't know the iOS version of your iDevice**, follow [this page from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109065) to check your iOS version.

| Method | Supported iOS | Computer Required | Mod Support | Price |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [TrollStore / Jailbreak](/OLD-IOS-INSTALL.md) | iOS 14–17.0 (excluding 16.7.x+ & 17.0.x+) | No* | Full (Native JIT) | Free |
| [SideStore](/MODERN-IOS-INSTALL.md) | iOS 14+ | First-time setup only | Full (JIT) / Partial (JIT-less) | Free |
| [Apple Developer Certificate](/APPLE-DEV-CERT-INSTALL-GUIDE.md) | iOS 14+ | No* | Full (JIT) / Partial (JIT-less) | Paid |
| [Free Certificates](/ENTERPRISE-INSTALL-GUIDE.md) | iOS 14+ | No | Partial | Free |
| [LiveContainer](/LIVECONTAINER-INSTALL-GUIDE.md) | iOS 15+ | Yes* | Full (JIT) / Partial (JIT-less) | Free |

In case you still do not know which installation method to use, look at the image below (starting on the white box) to see which guide you should use. (ending on the green box)

> [!NOTE]
> The guides are accessible by clicking on the names of each guide on the table.

> TrollStore method also has an option to install a jailbreak tweak if you prefer to use Geode that way.

> Apple Developer Certificate method only requires a computer if you want to enable JIT. LiveContainer indirectly requires a computer as LiveContainer itself has to be sideloaded through SideStore

# Which Method is The Most Suitable For You?
> [!NOTE]
> Methods that say **"can go up to full support"** mean the method provides **partial mod support by default (JIT-less)**, but can be extended to **full mod support (JIT)**. Full mod support **always requires a computer to set up**.
> \
> \
> Don't worry, your favorite mods like **CBF, Eclipse, Globed and more will work out of the box** on **partial mod support (JIT-less)**.
> \
> \
> Methods that **support the latest iOS versions** work on **iOS 14 or above** (iOS 14 being the minimum version for the Geode launcher). The exception is **LiveContainer**, which requires **iOS 15 or above**.

Here's a comparison of all methods for you to see which method is the most suitable for you:

## TrollStore
🌟 If your device supports it, this is THE best option to install Geode 🌟
### Pros
- Full mod support
- Easy to setup
- Works very reliably

### Cons
- Limited iOS version support (iOS 14-17.0, excluding 16.7.x+ and 17.0.x+)
- Might require a computer to set up (if on-device options like using free certificates to install TrollStore do not work; iOS 17.0 requires a computer)

## SideStore
🚀 If you have a computer, don't want to pay for a certificate, and your device is on the latest iOS version, this is the best option to install Geode 🚀
### Pros
- Can go up to full mod support
- Supports up to the latest version of iOS
- Works reliably

### Cons
- Has some limitation on the amount of apps you can install due to Apple's restrictions (3 active apps and 10 app ID)
- Requires a computer to set up
- Will expire in 7 days if you don't frequently refresh it

## Apple Developer Certificate
💲 If you can pay for a certificate and don't have a computer, this is the best option to install Geode 💲
### Pros
- Can go up to full mod support
- Supports up to the latest version of iOS
- If you want to install apps other than Geode, this method does not have any app limits unlike SideStore

### Cons
- Apple developer certificates are paid
- Your certificate might get hit by Apple on a revoke wave, causing apps installed with it to crash
- Requires computer **if you want full mod support** (setting it up with partial mod support can be on device, no computer required)

## Free Certificates
❌ This is THE worst way to install Geode, and **should be avoided unless absolutely necessary** (such as not having a computer, not being able to pay for a certificate, or your device not supporting a great on-device option like TrollStore) ❌

### Pros
- Does not require a computer
- Supports up to the latest version of iOS
- Completely free to set up

### Cons
- Cannot go up to full mod support (JIT-less only)
- Takes a lot of storage, atleast 400 MB (as it involves installing a patched version of Geometry Dash)
- Time consuming to set up and use (as it not only involves finding the right certificate to install Geode, but it also involves having to patch Geode everytime you install, update, enable or disable mods or update Geode itself)
- Works unreliably, can run into issues
- Geode might get revoked, causing it to crash when trying to open it
- Violates Apple's Terms of Service (as you're using a leaked certificate that was previously used by a company)

## LiveContainer
👍 If you have SideStore and don't want to waste an active app and app ID slot, this is the best way to install Geode 👍
### Pros
- Can go up to full mod support
- Supports up to the latest version of iOS
- Completely free to set up
- Useful with SideStore, as it will let you preserve an active app and app ID slot 

### Cons
- Requires a computer (as it's supposed to be used together with SideStore)
- Might require some extra setup
